# novaprimepinger
A pinger themed around NovaPrime, makes your local skid happy! Looks like it's taken straight from a Pastebin named "Epic Gamer Pinger takes down ovh no virus 2020".
                         
What to say else, it has Minecraft and NovaPrime references. Especially the message you get right after opening it.
Pretty cool huh? Yeah, I made it look cool. Like I said, it makes your local skid happy!
It can't "down" anyone. It just makes it look like that. The combat logged is basically saying that it failed to ping. It's pretty fast.
The .exe version is faster than .bat version. So, if you want to look cool on your Fortnite TikTok account, this is the right tool!
